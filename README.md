## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup

This project requires Python **v3.10** or higher. It was developed and tested using Python **v3.13.1**. If you encounter issues running the specified version of dependencies, consider using this version of Python.

### üìù List of Dependencies

[![ipykernel](https://img.shields.io/badge/ipykernel-6.30.0-ff69b4)](https://pypi.org/project/ipykernel/6.30.0/)

### üì¶ Install Dependencies

#### üì¶ Method 1: Poetry (**Recommended** ‚úÖ)

Use [**Poetry**](https://python-poetry.org/) for dependency management. It handles dependencies, virtual environments, and locking versions more efficiently than pip.  
To install exact dependency versions specified in [**poetry.lock**](./poetry.lock) for consistent environments **without** installing the current project as a package:

```bash
poetry install --no-root
```

#### üì¶ Method 2: Pip

Install all dependencies listed in [**requirements.txt**](./requirements.txt) using [**pip**](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/):

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### üõ†Ô∏è Usage Instructions

1. Open the root folder with [**VS Code**](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (`Ctrl/Cmd + K` followed by `Ctrl/Cmd + O`).
1. Open `.ipynb` files using the [**Jupyter extension**](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-toolsai.jupyter) integrated with **VS Code**.
1. Select the correct Python kernel and virtual environment where the dependencies were installed.
1. Allow **VS Code** to install any recommended dependencies for working with Jupyter Notebooks.

‚úçÔ∏è **Notes**:  

- It is **highly recommended** to stick with the exact dependency versions specified in [**poetry.lock**](./poetry.lock) or [**requirements.txt**](./requirements.txt) rather than using the latest package versions. The repository has been **tested** on these versions to ensure **compatibility** and **stability**.
- This repository is **actively maintained**, and dependencies are **updated regularly** to the latest **stable** versions.
- The **table of contents** embedded in the **notebooks** may not function correctly on **GitHub**.
- For an improved experience, open the notebooks **locally** or view them via [**nbviewer**](https://nbviewer.org/github/mr-pylin/mavhine-learning-workshop).
